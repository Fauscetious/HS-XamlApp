Created as an open-ended school project, wherein the student utilizes Xaml, C#, and various APIs to create a UWP app of their own design. For this project, I made an app that pulls data from Bungie.net to create a sortable catalog of all items in the video game Destiny 2.

The main content of the project is located under the IndependentProject folder.
